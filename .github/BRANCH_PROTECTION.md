## GitHub CLI Commands

If you prefer CLI, you can set these via `gh`:

```bash
# Protect main branch
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection -X PUT \
  -F required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["build","test"]}' \
  -F enforce_admins=true \
  -F required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}'
```

## Rulesets (Recommended for GitHub Pro/Enterprise)

GitHub Rulesets provide more granular control. Consider using rulesets for:
- Commit message format enforcement
- File path restrictions
- Deployment environment gates
