### Changed
- **Simplified Architecture** - Major codebase simplification removing ~3,700 lines of code

  - Consolidated worker management into worker-pool.ts
  - Streamlined spawner.ts with cleaner spawn logic
- **Bridge Server Rewrite** - Simplified inter-process communication
- **Test Suite Overhaul** - Removed flaky/complex tests, kept essential coverage
  - Deleted 1,800+ lines of brittle test code

### Fixed
- Instance tracking issue causing sessions not to terminate properly with orchestrator

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **PostHog Telemetry** - Optional analytics integration for tracking worker spawns, task delegations, and workflow runs
  - Configure via `telemetry.apiKey` in orchestrator.json or `POSTHOG_API_KEY` env var
  - Disabled by default for privacy
- **Async Worker Jobs** - New `ask_worker_async` and `await_worker_job` tools for parallel worker execution
- **Workflow System** - RooCode Boomerang workflow for plan→implement→review→fix cycles
  - Configurable steps with carry-forward context
  - Security limits on steps, task size, and timeouts
- **Device Registry** - Cross-session worker reuse via persistent registry
  - Workers survive session restarts
  - Automatic cleanup of dead workers
- **Profile Locking** - Prevents duplicate worker spawns across processes
- **Bridge Server** - Internal communication layer for worker→orchestrator messaging
- **Message Bus** - Inter-worker messaging with `message_tool` for reports and cross-worker communication
- **Job Tracking** - Centralized job management with status tracking and results storage
- **Memory Auto-Recording** - Automatic chat message recording to Neo4j knowledge graph
- **Process Metrics** - CPU and memory monitoring for spawned workers

### Changed
- **Removed Debug Logging** - All console debug output removed to prevent TUI corruption
  - Logs now only go to internal buffer accessible via API
- **Simplified Logger** - Logger no longer emits to console, only buffers internally
- **Dynamic Port Allocation** - Workers now use port 0 by default for automatic assignment
- **Improved Model Resolution** - Better handling of `auto:*` and `node:*` model tags
- **Worker Reuse** - Orchestrator now reuses existing workers from device registry before spawning new ones

### Fixed
- Debug logs leaking into TUI display (especially in Ghostty terminal)
- Worker stdout/stderr now properly consumed to prevent parent process pollution
- Stale lock file cleanup for crashed processes

### Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
  - Unit tests for config merging, model catalog resolution
  - Integration tests for auto-spawn limits
  - Stress tests for concurrent spawns and job accumulation
  - Performance benchmarks for device registry and spawn operations
  - E2E tests for multi-agent workflows
- **JSON Schema Updates** - Added telemetry, workflows, security, and memory config schemas
- **Documentation Overhaul** - Streamlined docs into guide.md and reference.md

### Security
- Workflow security limits (maxSteps, maxTaskChars, maxCarryChars, perStepTimeoutMs)
- Worker isolation via session-based contexts
- Profile lock prevents race conditions in worker spawning
